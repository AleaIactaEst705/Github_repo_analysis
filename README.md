# GitHub Repository Analysis

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project analyzes GitHub repositories to evaluate the impact of AI-powered coding assistants on software development. The study investigates programming language trends, commit activity, and contributions by major tech companies.

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Contents
- ðŸ“˜ **[Jupyter Notebook](notebook.ipynb)** â€“ Contains the data processing, analysis, and visualizations.
- ðŸ“‘ **[Presentation Slides](slides.pdf)** â€“ Summarizes key findings and insights.
- ðŸ“Š **Data Processing & EDA** â€“ Cleaning, filtering, and exploring GitHub dataset (~1.36 TiB).
- ðŸ“ˆ **Commit & Language Trends** â€“ Evolution of programming languages and developer activity.
- ðŸ“œ **Big Tech Contributions** â€“ Role of OpenAI, Microsoft, and Google in AI repository growth.

## ðŸ›  Tools & Technologies
- **PySpark** â€“ Distributed data processing
- **Google Cloud Storage (GCS)** â€“ Data extraction & storage
- **SQL (Spark SQL)** â€“ Data querying & analysis
- **Python Visualization Libraries** â€“ Matplotlib, Seaborn, Pandas
- **Machine Learning Methods** â€“ Cosine similarity, tokenization, vectorization

## ðŸ“Š Key Insights
1. **Programming Language Trends**  
   - Python dominates AI & data science, while C++ and Java decline.  
   - JavaScript remains the leader in web development.

2. **Commit & Repository Activity**  
   - Peak commit activity was in 2017.  
   - Seasonal patterns indicate development slowdowns at year-end.

3. **Big Techâ€™s Role in AI Development**  
   - OpenAI and Microsoft significantly contribute to AI-related repositories.  
   - PyTorch, TensorFlow, and Transformer-based models are driving growth.

4. **Impact of AI on Software Development**  
   - AI tools improve productivity but do not replace human developers.  
   - Commit analysis shows AI is mostly used for minor modifications and automation.

## ðŸ“Œ How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Github_Repo_Analysis.git
   ```
2. Open and explore the **notebook.ipynb** in Jupyter Notebook.
3. Review insights in the **slides.pdf**.

## ðŸ“¢ Conclusion
- **AI-powered coding assistants enhance productivity but do not replace developers.**
- **Python and JavaScript continue to dominate, reflecting industry shifts.**
- **Big Tech plays a crucial role in AI-driven open-source growth.**
- **Organizations should integrate AI for automation while maintaining human-driven innovation.**
